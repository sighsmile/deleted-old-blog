Hi, I am Charlene. I have :

- Graduated from Peking University; 
- Read TAOCP vol.1 (edited its Chinese version, and got deeply confused, to be honest); 
- Translated two books from English to Chinese.

In my spare time, I :

- Take online courses; 
- Learn foreign languages, including Python, Japanese, French and Cantonese;
- Write this blog :-)

I want to :

- Get familiar with several languages;
- Travel around the world; 
- Get a PhD in mathematics; 
- Be myself, and be honest.
